## Security Scenario

Several potential security incidents have been discovered at XYZ, LLC. Assuming that proper preparations regarding incident response have already been completed, we want to resolve these as fast as possible in accordance with the company’s security protocols. The events in question are endpoint malware, successful phishing, and employee departure. In this project, we will walk through the various stages of incident response with each of these security incidents.

# Preparation

The very first step for incident response is preparation. At this stage, we form the incident response plan, establish roles and responsibilities, and gather everything that is needed to train a team of professionals to be ready when something goes wrong. This part of the process is vital because, in the event of security issues, the incident response team needs to know exactly what to do in order to respond quickly.

# Incident Identification

The next step is incident identification. In this phase, the incident response team needs to understand exactly what has occurred and whether it constitutes a security issue. In this scenario it’s obvious that malware on an endpoint and a successful phishing attack are security incidents, but what about the departing employee? This threat is not as immediate as the others but it is just as real.

# Containment

The goal of the containment phase is to mitigate damage. There are two important aspects to consider during this stage. We need to contain damage and at the same time preserve evidence. Tampering evidence is as simple as shutting down an affected machine or any other way evidence can be altered. While a balance between these goals is important, so is company information. Damage should not be permitted to spread just to collect it as evidence.

# Investigation

Next in the process is the investigation stage. At this point, the response team takes control of the damage and searches for the root cause of the incident. This part of the process is very similar to containment however evidence has been preserved and now we can collect it. We want to treat every real incident with the same care as a detective does.

# Conclusion

Once the investigation is complete, the next step is to conclude the incident. This means that we have identified the root cause, have resolved the issue, and have learned from the experience. At this stage, we will document all of the findings and create a post-incident report that includes recommendations for preventing similar incidents in the future. This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders and will be used to improve the company’s security protocols.

# Documentation

Throughout the incident response process, it is important to document everything that has occurred. This includes the preparation phase, the identification of the incidents, the containment and investigation steps, and the conclusion of the incidents. This documentation will be used to create the post-incident report and will be an invaluable resource for improving the company’s security protocols.
