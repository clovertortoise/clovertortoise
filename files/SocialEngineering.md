# Social Engineering

Social engineering is a type of attack that relies on people making mistakes. The attacker's goal is to trick the target into revealing sensitive information. This type of attack is becoming more common because people do not always follow proper security practices or are simply uninformed.

## Risks

Social engineering attacks are most prevalent on social networking sites, where it is easy for attackers to collect personal information. This information can then be used to gather even more information through social engineering. Scams on social media can also compromise accounts and trick people into sending money or giving up personal information.

Businesses are also at risk from social engineering attacks. Sensitive information about company activities can be leaked on social media, either intentionally by a disgruntled employee or accidentally by someone who is not aware of the sensitivity of the information.

## Avoiding Attacks

To avoid falling victim to social engineering attacks, there are several steps you can take:

- Secure your browser by blocking pop-ups, installing anti-malware, and using private browsing.
- Practice secure computer usage by not clicking on links in emails or messages from unknown sources, and by not giving out personal information unless you are certain of the legitimacy of the request.
- Improve your password security by using unique, strong passwords for each of your accounts, and by regularly updating them.
- By following these steps, you can help protect yourself and your organization from the risks of social engineering attacks.
