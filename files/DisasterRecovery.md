# Disaster Recovery Plan

This disaster recovery plan is designed for the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS). The plan includes policies for restoring operations and reducing the impact of a disaster.

# Preparation

The first step in developing a disaster recovery plan is preparation. This includes maximizing fault tolerance by implementing various mechanisms such as RAID arrays, server clustering, and uninterruptible power supplies. Alternative sites, such as hot, warm, and cold sites, should also be considered in order to minimize downtime in the event of a disaster.

# Response

When a disaster occurs, the next step is to activate the disaster recovery plan. This includes identifying the specific type of disaster and implementing the appropriate response measures. For example, if a tornado hits the main KCTCS campus in Versailles, KY, the response would include activating the hot site, backing up any lost data, and coordinating with emergency services.

# Testing

In order to ensure the effectiveness of the disaster recovery plan, regular testing should be conducted. This can be done through drills, simulations, and audits. Testing will help identify any gaps or weaknesses in the plan and allow for improvements to be made.

# Maintenance

Once the disaster recovery plan is in place, it should be regularly reviewed and updated as needed. This includes keeping track of changes in technology, business operations, and potential disaster scenarios. By maintaining the plan, KCTCS can be confident that it is prepared for any disaster that may occur.
