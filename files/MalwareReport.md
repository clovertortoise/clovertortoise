# Malware Report

Malware plays a significant role in modern security. Threats caused by malware can affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is important to understand what it is, how it works, and who interacts with it. This report will cover the types of malware and how it is used to compromise security.

## What is malware?

Microsoft describes malware as any malicious software that disrupts or damages a device. These programs can harm systems and steal information. Malware can perform actions unintended by the user. So who is controlling these programs? Kaspersky suggests that cybercriminals use these programs against systems for several reasons. They could want to steal or modify data, crack passwords, or take control.

## How did malicious code come about?

Malware first began to spread throughout computers even before the internet existed. How is this possible? Before the internet, software was transmitted manually through the use of storage devices like floppy disks. Because of this, computer viruses took quite a while to spread. With the internet connecting systems together, malware was able to spread more quickly than ever before.

Malicious code can traverse the internet and find its way onto unsuspecting systems, but where did the idea of replicating code actually come from? Research and experiments can be found dating back to the 1970s. This code was not malicious but was intended for the maintenance of large networks. Instead of manually configuring and updating every device, this code could spread from each device and perform regular tasks automatically. The malicious potential of this code was researched in 1983 by Dr. Fred Cohen. He and colleagues shed light on how self-replicating code could be dangerous. Sure enough, a student in university, Robert Morris, released a worm that affected most of the UNIX computers connected to the internet in 1988.

## How has malware evolved?

Before personal computers could connect to the internet, the primary way to get software and transfer data were by floppy disk according to Vice. Naturally, the malware from this era exploited this. File infectors and boot sector viruses were common. File infectors would attack executable files, while boot sector viruses targeted components of the operating system.

As local area networks emerged so did a new way of malware propagation. Within groups of computers connected together, malicious code could more easily infect systems. The damage from malware caused businesses to more seriously consider solutions. New mediums of transfer such as email became available for malicious software.

Email worms could replicate by sending emails to the contacts of a victim's device. Simple attachments could infect a system. Other worms exploited web server vulnerabilities. More exploits were used once attackers realized the potential of weaknesses in web security.

In more recent events, malware has been able to hide in plain sight. This is through the use of insecure browser extensions. Extensions are convenient! They can block ads, find coupons, and unfortunately compromise security. Since browser extensions are available on most browsers, they can be used on most computers. Even mobile devices can be affected.

## Why is malware used and what are the motivations behind it?

Malware can be an attractive choice for attackers to achieve money, fame, influence, or revenge. Confidential information can be quite valuable in the wrong hands. Attackers could deface a website to establish notoriety. They could even take over a website to share their ideology. Maybe the attacker is a disgruntled employee who is upset and wants to harm the company. There are many motivations behind malware attacks and it is important to understand these motivations in order to properly defend against them.

## Types of malware

There are many different types of malware, each with its own methods of attack and characteristics. Some common types of malware include:

- Viruses: These are malicious programs that can infect other programs or files on a computer. They can spread from one device to another through infected files or email attachments.
- Worms: These are self-replicating malware that can spread quickly across a network without the need for user interaction. They can exploit vulnerabilities in network security to gain access to systems.
- Trojans: These are malicious programs that are disguised as legitimate software or files. They can trick users into installing them, allowing the attacker to gain access to the victim's device.
- Ransomware: This type of malware encrypts a victim's files and demands payment for the decryption key. It can cause significant damage to a victim's data and systems.
- Adware: This type of malware displays unwanted advertisements on a victim's device. It can slow down a device and cause annoyance to the user.
- Spyware: This type of malware can monitor a victim's activity and steal sensitive information. It can be difficult to detect and remove.

## Conclusion

Malware is a significant threat to modern security and can cause harm to systems and steal sensitive information. It is important to understand the types of malware and their motivations in order to properly defend against them. It is also crucial to regularly update and maintain security measures in order to protect against the latest threats.
